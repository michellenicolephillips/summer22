               Native to Africa, there are nine subspecies of Giraffes. What sets them apart from each other are the different regions of Africa in which they live and slight variation on their coat patterns. Giraffes are the tallest land animal as well as the largest hoofed herbivores on earth. Giraffes are easily identified by their long necks and limbs and their spotted coats. They reside in grasslands and savannas. Their diet consists of leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, usually of the acacia species as they are found at heights other animals cannot reach.

               Giraffe Breeding
          </h3>
          <p>
               Male giraffes take part in a ceremony called "necking" where they use their necks as weapons to display dominance over one another. The males that win at necking, have greater reproductive success. Giraffes are polygamous. Only a few older males will mate with the fertile females. Gestation lasts between 400 and 460 days before a single calf is born. The newborn calf is born around 6 feet tall and can run around within a few hours of being born. Mother calves will move together in "nursery herds," using each other to watch after their newborns while they may venture elsewhere for food. Males don't help raise the young.
