              Lions are a large cat native to Africa and India. Male lions are larger than female are are distinguishable by their prominent manes. Lions live in groups called "prides." A pride consists of a few adult males and females and their cubs. The female lions do the hunting in groups, preying on hooved animals such as giraffes, rhinos, and deer. Lions are apex predators, the top of their food chain. They live in grasslands and savannas.

          <p>
               Female lionesses reproduce by age four. Lions don't mate a specific time of year.Lionnesses can mate with more than one male when in heat. Gestation period is around 110 days. Lionnesses give birth to a litter of one to four cubs in a secluded den, away from the pride. Lion cubs are born blind and open their eyes about a week after birth. The cubs are not integrated back into the pride until they are six to eight weeks old.
