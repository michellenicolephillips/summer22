              Giant Pandas, more commonly referred to as Panda Bears, are exclusively found in certain mountain ranges in China, mainly Sichuan. It's recognized by its bold black and white fur and round body. Giant pandas' diets consist of mostly bamboo shoots and leaves. Occasionally they eat meat from birds and rodents. Because of deforestation, giant pandas lives are threatened and they are on the vulnerable species conservation watch list. The giant panda is China's national symbol.

          <p>
               Giant Pandas reach sexual maturity between four and eight years old and can reproduce until they're twenty. They can produce a cub every two years. The mating season in the wild is between March and May. Twin baby pandas occur in about half of pregnancies. If twins are born in the wild, the mother will care for the stronger of the two, leaving the other to die of starvation.

               Red Pandas are native to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China. Known as the "lesser panda," red pandas are much smaller than giant pandas. THey are 20-25 inches in length and only seven to 33 lbs in weight.They're climbers due to their flexible joints and semi-retractible claws. They're closely related to raccoons, weasels, and skunks. Red pandas also feed on bamboo shoots and leaves but also eat fruits and blossoms as well. Red pandas are threatened by poachers and deforestation.
