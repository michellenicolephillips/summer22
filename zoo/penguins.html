          <p>
               Southern Rockhopper Penguins reside in the subantartic waters of the western Pacific and Indian Oceans as well as on southern coasts of South Africa. The Southern Rockhopper Penguin is the smallest yellow-crested penguin, reaching a length of 18-23 inches.They have straight bright yellow eyebrows that extend in long yellow plumes projecting sideways. They have red eyes. A majority of their population live on the Falkland Islands and on islands off Patagonia. Their name comes from their behavior of getting around by jumping over boulders and across cracks. Southern Rockhopper Penguins eat mostly crustaceans with the occasional fish.

               Emperor penguins live exclusively in Antartica. They are the tallest and heaviest penguins species.  Emperor penguins have a white belly with pale-yellow breast and bright-yellow ear patches. Emperor penguins eat mostly fish but also eat krill and quid. They can remain submerged in water for up to 20 minutes and can go as deep as 1755 feet while hunting for their food.

          <h3>
               Emperor Penguin Breeding
          </h3>
          <p>
               Emperor Penguins can start breeding around 3 years old. During April and May, all adult penguins travel to the nesting grounds, often 30 to 75 miles inland from the edge of the ice. The season is triggered by shortening day lengths. The female penguin lays one egg around May/June. The male will spend the next two months incubating the egg for about 65 -75 days prior to hatching. Shortly after the egg is hatched, the female returns to raise the hatchling.
